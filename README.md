- Clone & install dependencies
- Configure your Appwrite project (endpoint, project & platform IDs)
- Run locally with Expo Go or simulators
- Understand the folder layout and core features (authentication, data modeling, navigation)
- Extend or contribute to the codebase

## Usage

### Authentication

- **Sign up** via email/password: uses `Account.createEmailPassword`
- **Login/Logout**: calls `Account.createEmailPasswordSession` & `Account.deleteSession`

### Database

- Collections & documents accessed through Appwrite’s `Databases` service
- Use hooks like `useCollection` to fetch & subscribe to data changes

### Navigation

- File-based routing (Expo Router) or
- `@react-navigation/native-stack` for stack-based flows
